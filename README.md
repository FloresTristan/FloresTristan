👋 Hi, I’m @FloresTristan, also known as Michael Flores.

👀 I’m interested in technology and fantasy, particularly in web development and programming.

🌱 I’m currently learning PHP MVC with OOP, SQL databases, and developing custom Discord bot commands using Python.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, especially those involving complex back-end functionalities and database management.

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through my personal gmail michaeltristanflores646@gmail.com, or connect with me here on GitHub.

😄 Pronouns: Attack helicopter

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Computer Engineering technology student and an OJT Trainee at Pustanan Printers in Cebu, where I work on exciting web development projects while also delving into my love for tech and fantasy.
